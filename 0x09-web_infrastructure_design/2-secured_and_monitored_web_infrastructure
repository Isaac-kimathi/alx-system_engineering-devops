Additional elements, why you are adding them?
Firewalls: To provide an addictional layer of security, controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based security configuration.
SSL: ensure security by encryption of HTTP.
Monitoring: monitors server health, performance, and security in real-time, allowing proactive issue detection and resolution.
Issues with the infrastructure:
Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue?
It can expose decrypted traffic with the inter traffic.
Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue?
it poses a single point of failure
Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem?
it leads to uniform vulnerabilities, therefore potential systematic issues.
