1. Webserver: handles static content such as HTML, CSS, and images. Efficience processing of static requests and enhance resource allocation.
2. Application server: Executes dynamic code, process requests, and generate dynamic content. it ensures optimal handling of application logic and functionalities.
3. Database: store and retrieve data independently. enforces data persistence and separation of concerns between data storage and application logic.
This ensures scability, performance and maintainance. Therefore easier troubleshooting and resource optimization.
