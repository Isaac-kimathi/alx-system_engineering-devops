ADDICTIONAL ELEMENTS AND REASONS FOR ADDING THEM:
1. Load-balancer(HAproxy): distribution of incoming traffic among multiple servers to prevent overloading, ensuring better performance and availability.
2. Server 1 & 2: Two servers to handle incoming requests, creating redundancyand reducing SPOF.
DISTRIBUTION ALGORITHM FOR LOAD-BALANCER AND HOW IT WORKS:
HAproxy uses a Round Robin distribution algorithm, distributes requests evenly among servers to maintain balance and prevent overloading.
Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both.
It's enabling an Active-Active setup.
Active-Passive: One server handles traffic actively while the other remains on standby, providing redundancy incase of failure.
Active-Active: All servers actively handles traffic simultaneous, promoting better resource utilization.
How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works?
The primary node handles write operations, and the replica node copy data from the primary, handling read operations. Therefore ensuring data redundancy, fault tolerance, and scalability.
What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application?
Primary nodes: handles write operations, updating the databse with new data.
Replica nodes: handles read operations, providing a scalable solution for serving multiple read requests.
The issues are with this infrastructure are:
1. SPOF may occur at the load balancer.
2. security issues because there is no firewall or HTTPS
3. No monitoring tools may lead to undetected issues.
